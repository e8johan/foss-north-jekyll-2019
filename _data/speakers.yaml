  title: "Understanding user namespaces"
  abstract: "User namespaces are at the heart of many interesting technologies that allow isolation and sandboxing of applications, for example running containers without root privileges and sandboxes for web browser plug-ins. In this tutorial, we'll look in detail at user namespaces, building up a basic understanding of what a user namespace is and going on to questions such as: what does being &ldquo;superuser inside a user namespace&rdquo; allow you do (and what does it not allow); what is the relationship between user namespaces and other namespace types (PID, UTS, network, etc.); and what are the security implications of user namespaces? We'll also explore some simple shell commands that can be used for creating and experimenting with user namespaces in order to better understand how they work. Along the way, there will hopefully be time for a few live demos."

  abstract:
    - You maintain an Open Source project with great code? Yet your project isn’t succeeding in the ways you want? Maybe you’re struggling with funding or documentation? Or you just can’t find new contributors and you’re drowning in issues and pull requests? Open Source is made up of many components and we are often better-trained in methods for writing good code, than in methods for succeeding in the other dimensions we want our project to grow. In this talk we’ll explore the different components of an Open Source project and how they work together. After this talk you’ll be well-equipped with a ideas and strategies for growing, cultivating, and nourishing your Open Source project. 
    - For your project to succeed, all of its non-code components must be well-maintained. What are these different components and what methods can we learn to maintain them?
    - "<ul><li>Build real relationships with your sponsors and determine ways how both sides can benefit from this relationship, don’t just ask people for money.</li><li>Establish a good communication system with your contributors: Keep them informed, listen to their feedback and input, make them feel heard.</li><li>Thank the people who worked on ticket triage or marketing, not just those who wrote code, in your release notes.</li><li>Make it easy for new contributors to get started: Write and maintain good documentation, answer questions in a friendly and timely manner.</li><li>Market and evangelize in the right places and at the right time: Give conference talks, organize sprints, keep your project’s Twitter account active, always curate new and interesting content on your blog or website.</li><li>Implement a Code of Conduct and enforce it if needed: Make your project a safe space to contribute for everyone.</li></ul>"
    - With these methods and a half-dozen others, you’ll handle beautifully all the components your project needs to succeed.

What comes first, specification or implementation? Where does innovation happen, and what is the platform to develop consensus on technical standards in a market segment? Based on research work at TU Berlin and for the Joint Research Center of the European Commission and the work of the Open Invention Network to protect key FOSS projects from patent litigation, the presentation will discuss the current state of the debate at the European and international level, and provide an outlook on how the roles and functions of standards-development organisations and the wider FOSS community are converging.

No matter what your role is, you can apply a few key principles from the technical writing world to make your project more docs-friendly, and therefore more user- and contributor-friendly."

And their presence is ever growing. Last year alone 31 billion (!) of them were shipped, up from 23 billion in 2015. And they get more capable every day. A modern embedded system has threads, can run Python or JavaScript, and use machine learning models. Why are you not developing for them yet?"
    - "In this talk you'll learn that microcontrollers are not scary, that there's no magic involved, and that working in very constrained systems is actually very fun! You'll also learn a thing or two about getting things to run for years on a battery, try that with a web app. In this talk we'll use Mbed OS, the largest open source Real-Time Operating System for microcontrollers.

    - "But what can we learn today from the wild world of pre-copyright classical music? What mistakes did they make? What did classical music — as performed & composed in the past — appear to get right that we could emulate?"
    - "In this provocative and non-technical talk you will not only learn about how the lack of copyright enforcement or efficient distribution of music affected what was commissioned, composed & performed, you will also discover possible parallels to modern concepts of patents and trademarks."
    - "In addition, we will explore how the classical world was subject to many social factors we would easily recognise today including Imposter Syndrome, issues around diversity, the role of money, patronage, hoarding and standardisation… as well as ever-present psychological factors of fame, dogma and how limitations continue to shape our world."

Most of the value that the conductor (community manager) brings to the orchestra (community) is carried out before the performance (behind the scenes). In this session, I will share my experiences in orchestras and open source communities big and small across different countries. How do you take care of the different types of contributors/players and bring out their best? What happens when they have differences in opinion on how to collaborate? How do you make the community welcoming and inclusive especially for people with different backgrounds and who may not speak your (programming) language? Join me on a musical journey through some of the common (and perhaps not so common) dissonances of community orchestration and their possible resolutions!"

  abstract: 
    - "By using tools where you have a clear separation between code branches that makes effects and the ones that doesn't, as for example Haskell, it's very easy to argue that this can be done in a fairly easy manner. But it's not always the case that if a specific code branch is allowed to have side-effects, these should be all possible side-effects. In this short talk, we will be showcasing how you will be able to further restrict effects, granularly and even recursively, in order to limit these side-effects. An example could be an application that only needs to access data from a specific website, limited to a relative URL, and then print it to the console. These effects restrictions will be designed into the application, which will allow you to outsource development to anyone with the right skill-set, even if they have bad intentions, knowing that they will live up to 100% the design or the application will not build."
